# notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for

* teaching/learning analysis
* describing workflows/pipelines

## Folder structure

* `projects` contains notebooks written for specific projects, and may serve as a useful starting point for others
* `utils` are notebooks for performing various, usually non-analysis-related tasks (such as checking stimuli)
* `preprocessing` is for notebooks dealing with cleaning/conditioning data (`maxfilter`, bandpass filtering, ...)

## Dependencies

Many notebooks will depend on other `meeg-cfin`-repositories/modules, notably

* stormdb-python
* meeg-python

To get these installed/available, follow the instructions in the module docs and on the wiki.
